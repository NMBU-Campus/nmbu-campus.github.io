In addition to the ontology itself, the RealEstateCore Consortium also hosts the development of several software tools that support the adoption and utilization of REC and other ontologies.

* [OWL2OAS](/OWL2OAS/) -- This is a converter for translating 
OWL ontologies into OpenAPI Specification documents. 
OpenAPI Specification is a standard for describing 
REST endpoints and operations. This tool generates 
REST endpoints for the classes (i.e., concepts) 
declared in an ontology, and generates JSON-LD 
schemas for those classes based on the object and 
data properties that they are linked to in the 
ontology (either via rdfs:domain/rdfs:range, or 
via property restrictions). OWL2OAS is used to 
generate the official RealEstateCore REST API.
